a -> genome = connection pathways and "traits/neurons" are active/have the ability to be active defined with hexadecimal that represent nibbles
# genes equals the number of connections possible (think of internal neurons as non-inverting or inverting amplifiers)

1. bit 1 = source type (0 -> input sensory neuron or 1 -> internal neuron)
2. bit 2-8 = source ID (identifier which input neuron or which internal neuron "7-bit field as an unsigned value and take modulo the number 
of neurons involved to get exact neuron")
3. bit 9 = sink type (1 -> goes to internal neuron or 0 -> goes to an output action neuron)
4. bit 10-16 = sink ID (same as source ID except for sink connections for current neuron)
5. bit 17-32 = weight float value between -4.0 and 4.0 (divide 2^8 - 1 by 8 or 9 thousand)
# map indices of IDs to certian neurons with each brain having same initial map/config of neurons with a neuron having a unique index for every brain

b -> initial neurons = a set of input sensory neurons, a set of output action neurons, and a 
set of internal neurons used for strengthening or weakening a "signal"
